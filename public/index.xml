      <description>This is a copy of a post, originally written on Medium. I&#39;ve since rehosted it on my own site.

      <description>Hey, I&#39;m Ken! Nice to meet you üëã
I&#39;m a Senior Software Engineer working in NYC who&#39;s passionate about programming, motivated by curiosity, and who wishes he were better at guitar.
On my honeymoon in France, about to dig into a wonderful crepe  By day, I typically write in Ruby, Go, and Typescript (using React); by night, I like to work on a variety of projects, most recently my programming language Abra, which is written in Rust.</description>
