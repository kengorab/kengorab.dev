<p>By day, I typically write in Ruby, Go, and Typescript (using React); by night, I like to work on a variety of projects, most recently my programming language <a href="https://abra.kenrg.co/">Abra</a>, which is written in Rust.</p>
<p>I also enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next book in <em>The Stormlight Archive</em>. I've also been on book 11 of <em>The Wheel of Time</em> for the past couple years, one day I'll finish it&hellip; Also, <em>The Expanse</em> is one of my favorite sci-fi series in a while, check it out if you're interested (read the books before you try the show). Also also, you should read <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/series/112296-the-broken-earth"><em>The Broken Earth Trilogy</em> by N.K. Jemisin</a>, it's an excellent fantasy series. You can check out my <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66527592-ken-gorab">Goodreads</a> profile if you're interested.</p>
