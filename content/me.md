Hey, I'm Ken! Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer working in NYC who's passionate about programming, motivated by curiosity, and who wishes he were better at guitar.

By day, I typically write in Ruby, Go, and Typescript (using React); by night, I like to work on a variety of projects, most recently my programming language [Abra](https://abra.kenrg.co/), which is written in Rust. I like to write blog posts about a variety of topics that interest me, and I kind of use them as excuses to try and reimplement some tools/libraries that I use and enjoy.

I also enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi, and I'm eagerly awaiting the next book in _The Stormlight Archive_. I've been on book 11 of _The Wheel of Time_ for the past couple years, one day I'll finish it... Also, _The Expanse_ is one of my favorite sci-fi series in a while, check it out if you're interested (read the books before you try the show). Also also, you should read [_The Broken Earth Trilogy_ by N.K. Jemisin](https://www.goodreads.com/series/112296-the-broken-earth), it's an excellent fantasy series. You can check out my [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/66527592-ken-gorab) profile if you're interested.
