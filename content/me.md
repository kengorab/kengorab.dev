title: "About Me"

Hey, I'm Ken! Nice to meet you ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Senior Software Engineer based in NYC who's passionate about programming, motivated by curiosity, and probably
spends a bit too much money on _Magic: The Gathering_.

By day, I typically write in Ruby, Go, and Typescript (using React), but I "grew up" on Java and Scala. By night, I like
to work on a variety of projects, most passionately my programming language [Abra](https://abra.kenrg.co/), which is
written in Rust. I also enjoy digging into tools and libraries that I use on a daily basis, and love trying to
reimplement them myself from scratch. Occasionally (though not as often as I'd like), I try to write blog posts about
them. Check out [my github](https://github.com/kengorab)!

I also really enjoy reading fantasy and sci-fi; top 3 series at the moment are:

1. The Stormlight Archive
2. The Expanse (the show is great, but the books are better)
3. The Broken Earth Trilogy
